# Universal Physics Framework

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive framework for organizing and developing theoretical physics research according to the Universal Physics Framework structure. The framework categorizes physics problems into theoretical inconsistencies, empirical anomalies, and theoretical/empirical inconsistencies.

## Framework Structure

The directory structure follows the Universal Physics Framework decomposition:

- **Spacetime & Mechanics Framework**: Classical and relativistic mechanics
- **Relativistic Framework**: Special and General Relativity
- **Thermodynamic & Statistical Framework**: Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics
- **Quantum Framework**: Quantum mechanics and interpretations
- **Quantum Field Framework & Standard Model**: QED, Electroweak, QCD, and Standard Model
- **The Cosmological Empirical Frontier**: Cosmology and dark matter/energy
- **Condensed Matter & Emergent Phenomena**: Solid state and quantum information
- **Future/Hypothetical Physics**: GUTs and exotic physics
- **Particle Physics Foundations**: Empirical data from particle physics
- **Cosmological Observations**: Empirical cosmological data
- **Nuclear Physics Constraints**: Nuclear physics measurements
- **Fundamental Constant Measurements**: Precision measurements
- **Symmetry Tests**: Experimental tests of fundamental symmetries
- **Critical Missing Theoretical Components**: Empirically-supported theoretical elements

## Usage

Each directory is designed to accommodate research projects of varying scales, from simple theoretical notes to large computational simulations. The structure allows for systematic development and validation of theoretical models.

## Contributing

This framework is designed for systematic physics research and model development. Contributions should maintain the hierarchical structure and follow the established categorization principles.
